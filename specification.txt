A program will be created that will enable a user to play a game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. A simple command line interface will be used to gather input and display game information to the user. The user will be prompted to enter the hand they would like to play, the computer will randomly select it's own hand, and the outcome of the round will be displayed to the user. The user will play five rounds, after which the overall winner will be displayed.
